# Welcome to HackQ for Swift (MacOS)

## Features:
- Gets questions directly from the HQ WebSocket
- Solves them using a complex search method created by [Daniel Smith](https://github.com/DanielSmith1239/)
- Clean, friendly, simple UI

## How to use:
- Download the repo/clone it
- Enter in your info (Bearer token, user id, Google API key, Google CSE ID) [you have to fill in the info in ViewController.swift and SiteEncoding.swift]
- Run a pod install to make sure everything is up to date
- Run the project... if you start it before the game is live, it won't connect because the socket url isn't available, so once the game is live, click the "HackQ" label at the top of the window (or you can just wait until the countdown starts to launch it)

## Support:
- If you need any help, open an issue, I will try to help


## Disclaimer:
- This is meant for educational use only, I do not advise you to use this in an actual HQ game because it is against their terms of service
